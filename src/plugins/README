Wave pluginsystem v1.0

Wave is a MVC built ground up to be extensible using the object orientation paradigm
It adapts ideas from many of the major open source and closed source systems such as Drupal, EPiServer and other 
smaller, och larger enterprise MVC frameworkds.

The plugin system is designed in such a away that all plugins developed may extend on others to make it easier to
alter the plugins without hacking into the code that already exists.

The plugin system also implements a hook API framework with ideas taken and refined from Drupal.

Each plugin must supply a manifest.xml file that defines all attributes for the plugin, including,
name, external libraries, dependencies, system load order, hooks implemented, hooks exposed.

The hook system is much like a event system, a plugins manifest file declares which hooks it's going to implement
when a hook is fired from any part of the wave system all plugins implementing that hook is alerted and the 
implemented hook callback is invoked with all the arguments.

The idea of using manifest.xml's in each plugin comes from the need to bring down the overhead of always needing to
look for a hook implementation in EVERY module, in this way we are able to create a index
in the database with all the plugins and which hooks they are implementing.

This index is rebuilt on "plugin page save" or "plugin cache flush".
During development of a application it is therefor recommended to run WAVE in developer mode, 
when running wave in developer mode it rebuilds the plugin hook index on each pageload.
